vagiosity-rover
===============

Software to control Vagiosity Rover robot. It is an iOS project with two apps. One app controls an Arduino-based robot and transmits video from camera over Wi-Fi, while the other shows the provided video and acts as a controller for the robot.

The robot is currently in a working condition and was successfully demonstrated on 12-05-2014 locally at Sibers.
All the works on the project are frozen and will start again somewhere in June-July '14.
